# NCDevCon 2017 Demo Source

This repository contains the source code for the sample applications demonstrated in my NCDevCon 2017 presentation. In this session, I created basically the same app using four different open source mobile development approaches:

+ [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.io)
+ [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)
+ [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
+ [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)

For each application, I created a simple UI that renders a list of mobile device capabilities exposed through the target development platform's native API interface. For example, in the Cordova sample application (shown below), I used the [Cordova Device](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-device/) plugin to retrieve (and display) details about the device that are only available at the native API level on the device (in other words, not normally available to the web browser).

**Note:** I originally published my session's presentation file to slideshare.net, but, for some reason the slides are no longer available there. I published a backup copy of the presentation at my personal blog at [https://johnwargo.com/mobile-development/ncdevcon-2017-presentation.html](https://johnwargo.com/mobile-development/ncdevcon-2017-presentation.html).

Here's a link to a recording of the session:
