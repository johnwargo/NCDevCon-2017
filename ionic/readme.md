# NCDevCon 2017 Presentation: Ionic Sample

This repository folder contains the source code for the Ionic version of the sample application I demonstrated at NCDevCon 2017. The application uses the Ionic framework's interface to the [Cordova Device](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-device/) plugin to retrieve data about the device running the application and displays it in a list in the application's main UI.
