# NCDevCon 2017 Presentation: Apache Cordova Sample

This repository folder contains the source code for the Apache Cordova version of the sample application I demonstrated at NCDevCon 2017. The application uses the [Cordova Device](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-device/) plugin to retrieve data about the device running the application and displays it in a list in the application's main UI.

For those of you who have been around the Cordova space for a while, you may have noticed that the application uses the [Topcoat](http://topcoat.io/) CSS framework for the app's UI.
