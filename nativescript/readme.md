# NCDevCon 2017 Presentation: NativeScript Sample

This repository folder contains the source code for the NativeScript version of the sample application I demonstrated at NCDevCon 2017. The application uses the NativeScript APIs to retrieve data about the device running the application and displays it in a list in the application's main UI.
